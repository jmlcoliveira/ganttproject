Conclusion:

As we can see in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2
On sheet 1 we can see the total number of methods in the gantproject (6862)
And on sheet 2, the number of methods without comments in the ganttproject in a whole (6030)

Therefore, only 12% of the methods in the gantproject are commented out, which made it very difficult to
understand the project over these weeks.

This information is more notable on Sheet 3, where I marked in yellow the average of lines with
comment per method (0.36 lines of comment per method and 0.2 javadoc comments) which makes it obvious that many
methods are not commented.

I also pointed out, on Sheet 3, the orange color that shows the maximum number
of lines in a class (1032), a possible code smell that was accentuated in phase 1 of the project (Large Class).

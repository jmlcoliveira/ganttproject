When looking at the use case diagram I agree with what was done regarding
the use case "Delete Resource" and "Send email".

Regarding "Manage columns" I don't think it's even a use case, I think that the column is a way
to access others use cases.

My major critic is regarding the use case "Edit resource" which seems to be an empty
use case where everything that makes the use case extends it. What I think is that probably
it should've been inherited by the uses cases that extends it (since these use cases have one thing
in common - they changes some properties of a resource).

I also think that it's a bit weird to make the use case add resourse inherit from "Edit resource".
